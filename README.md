# ReeBiS

ReeBiS (Resource Breakdown Structure) - is a tool for small companies to do resource projections across multiple projects.  There does not seem to be a tool that does this in the FOSS community and most project management sites suggest using a spreadsheet.  The pivot tables became unwieldy and entering data was non-intuitive.
